> Use various [FeatherJS](https://github.com/feathersjs) services to manage a MongoDB server with [Amity](https://www.npmjs.com/package/amity).
 
`feathers-amity-mongodb` lets you manage an entire MongoDB server.  It uses several feathers services:

* [`feathers-mongo-database`]()
* [`feathers-mongo-collection`]()
* [`feathers-mongo-user`]()
* [`feathers-mongodb`]()


## Installation

```bash
npm install feathers-amity-mongodb --save
```

## Getting Started

Create a Mongoose model the same way that you normally would.  Here is an example todos service:

```js
// ./server/services/todos.js

var mongoose = require('mongoose'),
  ObjectId = mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
  MongooseService = require('feathers-amity-mongodb');

// Set up the schema
var schema = new mongoose.Schema({
  description: String,
  done: Boolean,
  userID: ObjectId
});

// External access to the model.
var model = mongoose.model('Database', schema);

// Provide access to the service.
exports.service = new MongooseService(model);
```

### Use the Service

The service is now ready to be used by your feathers app:

```js
// server.js

var feathers = require('feathers');
var mongoose = require('mongoose');

// Connect to the MongoDB server.
mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost/feathers-example');

// Bring in service.
var todoService = require('./server/services/todos.js').service;

// Create a feathers instance.
var app = feathers();

// Set up public directory
app.use(feathers.static(__dirname + '/public'));

// Register services.
app.use('todos', todoService);

// Start the server.
var port = 80;
app.listen(port, function() {
	console.log('Feathers server listening on port ' + port);
});
```

Now you can use the todos example from [feathersjs.com](http://feathersjs.com) and place it in the public directory.  Fire up the server and watch your todos persist in the database.


## API

`feathers-amity-mongodb` services comply with the standard [FeathersJS API](http://feathersjs.com/api/#).

### Virtual Field for id
A virtual field will be set up on all service to automatically create an `id` out of each document's `_id`, so all documents will contain both an `id` and an `id` field.

This is added as a convenience for working with client-side frameworks that watch for an `id` to be present on model data. You can turn this off by passing {noVirtualID:true} in the second argument when creating the service:

```js
exports.service = new MongooseService(model, {noVirtualID:true});
```

### Special Query Params
The `find` queries allow the use of `$limit`, `$skip`, `$sort`, and `$select` in the query.  These special MongoDB features can be passed directly inside the query object:

```js
// Find all recipes that include salt, limit to 10, only include name field.
{"ingredients":"salt", "$limit":10, "$select":"name:1"} // JSON
GET /?ingredients=salt&%24limit=10&%24select=name%3A1 // HTTP
```

As a result of allowing these to be put directly into the query string, you won't want to use `$limit`, `$skip`, `$sort`, or `$select` as the name of fields in your document/schema.

### Working with Client-side Javascript Frameworks
Although it probably works well with most client-side frameworks, `mongoose-advanced-service` was built with CanJS in mind.  If you're making a CanJS app, consider using the [canjs-feathers plugin](https://github.com/feathersjs/canjs-feathers).


## Changelog

### 0.1.0
* `$select` support in a query allows you to pick which fields to include or exclude in the results.
* A virtual field for `id` is automatically added to every service.
* Removed support for filters in favor of using [feathers-hooks](https://www.npmjs.com/package/feathers-hooks).

### 0.0.4
You no longer have to pass in an id on findOne.  If an id is present, the query will be executed as a findById().  All other params will be ignored.  If no id is present, the params.query object will be used in a findOne().
